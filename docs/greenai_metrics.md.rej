 # Green AI Metrics
 
 The Hack4Earth challenge requires a **Scientific Carbon Impact (SCI)-style** comparison between a baseline and an optimised run for the same task.
 
 Minimum deliverables per region/run:
 
 1. `runtime_sec`
 2. `energy_kwh` (or proxy)
 3. `co2e_kg` with methodology note
 4. Hardware descriptor (CPU model, cores) and geographic region
 
 ### How to capture the metrics
 
 Wrap any command with the CodeCarbon helper:
 
 ```bash
 python engine/evaluate_greenai.py \
     --region hungary_transdanubia \
     --label baseline \
     --command "python scripts/train_region_model.py --region hungary_transdanubia --tier 1"
 ```
 
 This writes a JSON line under `models/<region>/greenai_runs.jsonl` with the required metrics and an execution log. Repeat with your optimised configuration (e.g., higher feature tier, tuned hyperparameters) and summarise the **before/after** in the submission notebook.
 
-For the carbon-aware bonus, record one of the runs during a lower-carbon window (e.g., UTC night for EU grids) or on Kaggle's `us-central1` CPU region and attach a screenshot/log of the scheduler time.
